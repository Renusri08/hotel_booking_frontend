# React + Vite(this is react+vite project)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (hot module refreshment) and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


# prebuilt ui.com
    for getting code directly choosing a component with the design we like.
    for all components there are multiple designs with codes available in this website.
# lucid-react(website) and library available (we can install it using npm -i lucid-react)
    here  instead of this svg icons we can use directly calling a simple component
 For example:
  for the email icon we have just used <Mail/> by simply importing it from lucid-react(lucid react icon)*/.
